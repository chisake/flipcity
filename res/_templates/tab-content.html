			My Motivation
		</p>
		<p>
			I was introduced to gymnastics in 1996 watching the Magnificent Seven win the first ever Gold Medal for the United States in the Women's Team Competition at the Atlanta Olympics.  I watched these young girls who were focused and dedicated to the most amazing, beautiful sport I had ever seen and I instantly wanted to be like them.  Their achievements made me realize that I didn't have to wait until I reached adulthood to do great things.  I likely would never go to the Olympics, but I was plenty capable of being strong, focused, and disciplined like the girls I watched on television.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once I started learning gymnastics, I did everything I could to get better at it as quickly as possible.  At 10 years old, I was doing 300 sit-ups and 100 pushups each night, not because anyone told me to but because I wanted to get better at gymnastics.  I had something to work for.  I had a reason to do more than watch television all summer.  Soon enough, I was showing off back walkovers and front handsprings to my family and friends.  I realized that I could do skills that most other people, adults included, could not.  I gained a confidence that I had not had before.  Each skill I mastered gave me one more accomplishment of which I could be proud.  I saw where hard work could lead me and that lesson motivated me throughout adolescence, college, and into adulthood.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is what I strive to teach kids every day.  Being young does not mean being incapable of doing great things.  Through gymnastics, kids learn to set and achieve goals.  Each skill mastered is a tangible accomplishment through which they can see their progress and develop confidence in their ability to achieve whatever goals they may choose in life.
